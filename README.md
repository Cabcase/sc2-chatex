# ChatEx

A chat extension mod for StarCraft 2

<!-- TODO: Video demo -->

## Features

ChatEx builds on top of the default chat and adds the following:

- Live typing indicator: displays a list of players that are currently typing
- Dynamic chat display: the chat display can be moved and resized
- Persistent chat: the chat display can be pinned which prevents messages from fading away over time
  - Hovering over the chat display will unfade old messages and darken the background to increase readability
- The chat bar is now multiline and will expand or shrink it's height based on the chat bar's contents
- Recent message history: players can retrieve past chat messages that they've sent
- Optional features that can be easily disabled based on your project's use case
  - A button to hide the chat display and live typing indicator
  - Cinematic Mode: players can toggle showing/hiding the game UI 
  - RPG Camera: when enabled makes the currently selected unit and moving the mouse while holding down the mouse wheel will orbit the camera around the unit
  - Chat Bubbles: when enabled chat messages will be displayed in a chat bubble above the currently selected unit and text in parentheses will be italicized in the chat bubble

## Installation

ChatEx is published as a public extension mod named `ChatEx Chat Extension` on Blizzard's SC2 services. For an SC2 mod ChatEx is very small (<50 KB). To add ChatEx to your map do the following:

1. Open your .SC2Map or .SC2Mod file in the SC2 editor
2. On the menu bar near the top left of the editor window click on `File>Dependencies...`
3. Below the left pane of the window that pops up click on `Add Other...`
4. On the next window click on the `Blizzard` tab near the top left corner
5. Log in to your Blizzard account
6. Set the `Source:` dropdown to `Map/Mod Name`
7. In the textbox to the right of the dropdown type `ChatEx` then click the `Go` button to the right of the textbox
8. Check the `Always Use Latest Version` checkbox
9. Select `ChatEx Chat Extension` in the list and then click on `Ok`

## Configuring ChatEx

1. Open your .SC2Map or .SC2Mod file in the SC2 editor
2. Open the editor's UI Module by clicking on `Modules>UI (Shift+F6)` in the menu bar near the top left of the editor
3. Add a layout file named `ChatEx_Config` by right clicking on the file tree pane on the left of the UI Module window and selecting `Add Layout (Ctrl+L)`
4. Replace the `ChatEx_Config` file's contents with the code snippet below

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
<Desc>
    <Constant name="ChatEx_RpgCameraButton_Visible" val="true"/>
    <Constant name="ChatEx_ChatBubblesButton_RightOffset" val="0"/> <!-- Button width = 32 -->
    <Constant name="ChatEx_CinematicModeButton_Visible" val="true"/>
    <Constant name="ChatEx_ChatBubblesButton_Visible" val="true"/>
    <Constant name="ChatEx_ChatBubblesButton_LeftOffset" val="0"/> <!-- Negative value moves the button to the left -->
    <Constant name="ChatEx_HideChatDisplayButton_Visible" val="true"/>
</Desc>
```

5. Modify the `val` attributes as needed
6. For more advanced customization options consider:
  - Using triggers, UI/Layout modding or the Text Module
  - Creating a seperate dependency mod that overrides ChatEx's SC2Layout files
